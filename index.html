						<h2>The Plant Breeding Journey</h2>
						<span class="byline"></span>
					</header>

					<p>
						Thank you for visiting my page! Since you are here, I would like to share with you a short story about how I became interested in Plant Breeding and Genetics.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						In the beginning of my undergraduate studies, I used to go with my mother to the school where she was a teacher, to study in the library while she was in class. In one of those days, when I was browsing through the bookshelves, one book caught my attention. It was the "DNA: The secret of life", by James D. Watson. Many things on that book were obscure for me at that time, but since the first moment I opened it, I notice that something powerful and important was being reported. After reading that book, besides the courses I was taking in my undergraduate program, I started to study genetics by myself. At that time, there was not many opportunities for undergraduate research in genetics in my campus, but to get started on research, I began working on soil fertility for grasses. I enjoyed my work there and it introduced me to the scientific research, but as I was moving forward with my independent studies with genetics, I knew that I should shift my focus.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After one year of that first encounter, in 2012 I received a scholarship to study abroad in an exchange program at the University of Alberta in Canada. I was excited because that was my chance to live in a different culture, interact with people from other countries and experience life in a new perspective. It was also an opportunity to attend inspiring classes in genetics and agronomy. Following the two semesters of studies at the university, I had the chance to do an internship for four months at DuPont Pioneer with canola breeding, also in Canada. This experience probably defined who I am today professionally because I could participate in the process of cultivar development in the breeding program and see the importance of genetics in the process.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After coming back to Brazil in the end of 2013, I was hired as an English teacher in a language school and for one year, I was teaching several classes from beginners to intermediate levels. This experience was fundamental for me to develop proficiency in English and to have the responsibility of conducting activities in a classroom environment. When I was still working as a teacher in 2014, I began another internship, this time at Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), working with sweet sorghum breeding. I was there for seven months and I could see a different perspective of the breeding process, this time with a different crop and in a public institution.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After obtaining my BS in Agricultural Engineering in the end of 2014, I took some time to think about which path I would take for my life. I decided to begin a breeding effort as an independent researcher with one of my professors from my undergraduate program. As I had some experience working with Canola, and this crop is not present in my home state, we had the idea of testing some varieties and make selections too see if there was a potential. We had some trials done and we started to select some genotypes, but soon I figured out that despite the internships, my knowledge on plant breeding was very limited to actually make progress with the selections. After that, we put the project on hold, and I decided to study plant breeding in graduate school.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						In 2016 I began my MSc at the University of São Paulo in Brazil. There I worked on the development of food-type soybean, where besides studying the genetic control of several traits, I made selections of new lines suitable for human consumption, with better flavor and higher yields. In addition to my main project, I learned important concepts in the courses I took, however the ones that had a greater impact in my decision on the PhD choice were Bioinformatics and Computational Tools Applied to Genomics. These courses developed in me an interest to study the genomic foundation of the traits I was evaluating in the breeding program.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						After going through the experiences mentioned before and having the time to improve my understanding of plant breeding and genetics, I have decided to pursue my PhD studies in the United States. Currently I am a second year PhD student in Plant Breeding, Genetics and Genomics at the University of Georgia, under Dr. Zenglu Li. At the UGA my work is focused on understanding the genetic control of seed composition and disease resistance in soybeans. I hope that in the future I can give back all the knowledge and experience I had the privilege to access and obtain, in the form of teaching or working in the development of new cultivars.
